**Cryptography and Cryptosystems**
=====================================

Cryptography is the practice of securing information and communications through the use of codes, ensuring that only the intended recipient can access and read the message. It is a fundamental tool in cybersecurity, used to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or tampering.

A cryptosystem is a structure or scheme that converts plaintext to ciphertext using algorithms for secure encoding and decoding. This typically involves:

*   Key generation
*   Encryption
*   Decryption techniques
*   A cryptographic key, which is a crucial component of the cryptosystem.

The main features of cryptography in cybersecurity include:
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Confidentiality**: Cryptography ensures that only authorized parties can access and read the information by encoding the data in a way that makes it unreadable to anyone without the proper decryption key.
2. **Integrity**: Cryptographic techniques, such as hashing and digital signatures, can detect if the data has been tampered with or altered during transmission or storage.
3. **Authentication**: Cryptography can be used to verify the identity of the sender of a message, ensuring that the data comes from a trusted source.
4. **Non-repudiation**: Cryptographic methods, like digital signatures, can prevent the sender from denying that they originated a particular message or transaction.
5. **Access Control**: Cryptography is used to restrict access to sensitive information or systems, ensuring that only authorized individuals or entities can gain access.

**Some common cryptographic techniques used in cybersecurity include:**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Symmetric-key Encryption**: Uses a single shared key between the sender and receiver to encrypt and decrypt the data, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).
- **Asymmetric-key Encryption**: Uses a pair of keys, a public key and a private key, to encrypt and decrypt data, such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman).
- **Hashing**: Converts data into a fixed-length, unique output (hash value) that can be used to verify the integrity of the data, such as SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm).
- **Digital Signatures**: Uses asymmetric-key encryption to provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation, such as RSA or ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).
